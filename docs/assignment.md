# Project Title: Efficient Search and Recommendation System for Books

## Introduction

In the digital age, efficient search and recommendation systems have become essential for managing large datasets and enhancing user experiences. Search algorithms allow users to quickly retrieve relevant information, while recommendation systems provide personalized suggestions based on user preferences. These systems power platforms like Amazon, Netflix, and Goodreads to help users discover books, movies, or products based on past interactions and interests.

Book recommendation systems play a crucial role in helping readers discover new titles based on their reading habits, ratings, and preferences. By leveraging advanced data structures and algorithms, we can build a system that efficiently searches for books and recommends similar or popular ones. This project focuses on implementing such a system using sorting algorithms, trees, heaps, and graphs to deliver an optimized and intelligent book recommendation platform.

## Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to design and implement an efficient search and recommendation system for books using fundamental algorithms and data structures. The system should allow users to:

* Search for books by title, author, or genre.
* Receive recommendations based on relevance, user preferences, and popularity.

Students will apply their knowledge of sorting, trees, heaps, and graphs to build a high-performance system capable of handling large book datasets efficiently.

## Application Use Case

**Book Recommendation System** – This project will:

* Enable users to search for books by title, author, or genre.
* Suggest similar books based on content similarity (title, genre, author).
* Provide top-rated and most popular books using ranking algorithms.
* Utilize graph-based models to recommend books based on connections (e.g., books frequently read together).

## Minimum Requirements

The system must include the following core functionalities:

### Search Functionalities

* Implement a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** for fast book lookup.
* Provide autocomplete suggestions based on user input.

### Sorting Functionalities

* Implement **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, or **Heap Sort** to sort books by ratings, reviews, or publication year.

## Advanced Requirements

### Recommendation Functionalities

* Implement a **Graph-based recommendation system**, where books are nodes and edges represent relationships (e.g., co-purchases, same genre, author collaborations).
* Use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** or **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to suggest related books.
* Implement a **Heap-based ranking system** to display the Top-K most popular books.

## Suggested Tools and Resources

* **Programming Languages**: Python (recommended) or any preferred language.

* **Datasets** (choose one or simplify if too large):

  * [Goodreads Books Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks)
  * [Amazon Kindle Books Dataset (130k books)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/amazon-kindle-books-dataset-2023-130k-books)

  *Note: If the dataset is very large, you may use a smaller subset.*

* **Algorithm References**:

  * Sorting: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
  * Search: Trie, BST
  * Graph: BFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  * Heap: Min-Heap, Max-Heap

## Project Deliverables

At the end of the project, students must deliver:

* **Source Code**: Fully functional implementation of the search and recommendation system.
* **Demo Presentation**: Showcase of the system’s features and performance.
* **(Optional) User Interface**: Basic CLI or web UI for user interaction.
* **Technical Report** detailing:

  * Requirements specification
  * Dataset description (e.g., Goodreads, Book-Crossing, Amazon Books)
  * Software engineering methodology
  * Object-Oriented Design of system components
  * Algorithm choices and rationale
  * Implementation details
  * Performance evaluation and complexity analysis
