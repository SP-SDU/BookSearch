## Background/Motivation

In the digital age, the increasing volume of books available online has made it challenging for readers to find books that match their interests. Traditional search methods often fail to provide personalized results, leading to a frustrating user experience. Additionally, readers often struggle to discover new books that align with their preferences, as they are limited by their own knowledge or the recommendation of others.

This project addresses these challenges by developing an **Efficient Search and Recommendation System for Books**. By leveraging advanced data structures and algorithms, the system aims to provide users with fast, accurate, and personalized search results and recommendations on large datasets, ensuring scalability and performance as the number of books and users grows.

## Aim

Create an intelligent and user-friendly book search and recommendation system that helps readers discover books tailored to their interests. The platform will combine efficient search capabilities with personalized recommendations to enhance the overall reading experience and support seamless exploration of new titles.

## Objectives

1. **Fast and Smart Search**

   * Use a Binary Search Tree (BST) for quick lookups.
   * Provide autocomplete suggestions.
   * Support searches by title, author, and genre.

2. **Efficient Sorting**

   * Implement Merge Sort, Quick Sort, or Heap Sort to organize books by ratings, reviews, and publication year.
   * Ensure sorting scales to large datasets.

3. **Graph‑Based Recommendations**

   * Model books as nodes and edges for co‑purchases, genre similarity, and author collaborations.
   * Use BFS or Dijkstra’s Algorithm to traverse and suggest related titles.

4. **Heap‑Based Ranking**

   * Maintain a Min‑Heap/Max‑Heap for Top‑K popular or highest‑rated books.
   * Enable O(log n) retrieval of top items.

5. **Scalability & Performance**

   * Optimize for large datasets, keeping search response under 2 s.
   * Write modular, maintainable code.

## Solutions

### Data Preprocessing

* Transform the Amazon Book Dataset into structured format.
* Handle missing values, standardize date formats, and normalize text.

### Search Module

* Multilayer queries over titles, descriptions, authors, etc.
* Features: autocomplete, dynamic filtering, and smart suggestions.

### Algorithmic Modules

* Hybrid strategies: graph‑based recommendations, similarity measures, popularity ranking, etc.

### User Interface

* Dashboard for search results and recommendations.
* Context menus and filters to navigate algorithm outputs.
* Emphasis on accessibility and usability.
